# Stereographic Cloud Base Reconstruction

This is the code for the algorithm presented in the publication “Stereographic Cloud Base Reconstruction using High-Resolution Whole Sky Imagers”. Reference to the paper will be provided here upon publication.

This algorithm estimates 3D models of the base of clouds in real world coordinates. It uses two images captured at the same time by two whole sky imagers positioned about 100 meters away. The resulting models have applications in meteorology, solar energy prediction or satellite communication signal attenuation.
